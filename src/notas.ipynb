    "### Notes on the Thesis Text\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic Forecasting in Meteorology**:\n",
    "   - Ensemble methods have long been a standard in meteorological forecasting, particularly for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP).\n",
    "   - These methods generate multiple point forecasts with slightly perturbed initial conditions, which are then aggregated into a probabilistic forecast, offering insights into forecast variability.\n",
    "   - **EMOS (Ensemble Model Output Statistics)**, proposed by Gneiting et al. (2005), addresses calibration issues but comes with disadvantages:\n",
    "     - Computational expense due to the need for multiple predictions (typically between 5 and 50).\n",
    "     - Strong assumptions on the distribution family (e.g., assuming a normal distribution and modeling its parameters).\n",
    "     - Small sample size for predicting mean and variance, even with 50 forecasts.\n",
    "   - The primary advantage is the ability to improve forecasts probabilistically without complex statistical modeling by leveraging established NWP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Probabilistic Forecasting Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Quantile Forecasting**:\n",
    "     - Involves modeling individual quantiles (as shown by Fenske et al. (2013) and Meinshausen (2006)).\n",
    "     - Optimal for point forecasts concerning the pinball loss function (Gneiting, 2011b).\n",
    "     - Not inherently probabilistic and faces issues like non-crossing quantiles, where lower quantiles may exceed higher quantiles.\n",
    "   - **Parametric Statistical Methods**:\n",
    "     - **GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location, Shape, and Scale)**:\n",
    "       - Described by Stasinopoulos and Rigby (2007).\n",
    "       - Uses generalized additive models to predict parameters of a chosen distribution family, offering flexibility and explainability.\n",
    "       - Classical statistical methods have not been widely adopted in weather prediction due to difficulties in modeling complex interactions and relevant features explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advances in Machine Learning**:\n",
    "   - Data-driven methods, particularly decision tree-based models, have become competitive in predictive performance.\n",
    "   - These models are better understood than neural networks but still offer strong predictive power.\n",
    "   - **XGBoost for Distributional Forecasting**:\n",
    "     - An extension proposed by März (2019) for distributional forecasting.\n",
    "     - Assumes a distribution family and predicts its parameters using trees fitted per parameter with negative log-likelihood as the loss function.\n",
    "     - Computationally efficient, leveraging implementations like XGBoost and PyTorch, and has performed well in forecasting competitions.\n",
    "   - **NGBoost (Natural Gradient Boosting)**:\n",
    "     - Proposed by Duan et al. (2020), it has been effective in competitions and research papers.\n",
    "   - **Probabilistic Gradient Boosting**:\n",
    "     - Proposed by Sprangers, Schelter, and Rijke (2021).\n",
    "     - Uses a stochastic tree ensemble approach where each leaf weight is a random variable.\n",
    "     - Advantage: Requires fitting only a single model for all parameters, enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "   - **Transformation Trees and Forests**:\n",
    "     - Proposed by Hothorn and Zeileis (2021), they allow flexible distribution modeling without assumptions about the distributional family.\n",
    "     - Theoretical foundation based on conditional transformation models (Hothorn, Kneib, and Bühlmann, 2013), but limited scalability due to full implementation in R.\n",
    "   - **NFBoost**:\n",
    "     - Combines and extends XGBoost and transformation models, using normalizing flows for modeling flexibility (März and Kneib, 2022).\n",
    "     - Discusses models developed and evaluated within the thesis."
